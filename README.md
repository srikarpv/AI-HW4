# AI -HW 4  
## Algorithms for Simple OpenAI Gym Environments

* For the final homework, you need to solve some simple reinforcement learning problems in OpenAI gym. You need to use jupyter notebooks to solve these and upload your solutions to your GitHub repo. You have to enter the link to GitHub repo in the text entry field for this homework.

* Make sure that you install Anaconda Python on your computer and create a GitHub account (which is absolutely free of charge for students). 

### Problem 1:

* Implement an explicit policy for the mountain car environment without using any learning algorithm. Explain in detail your reasoning behind your policy and run several test episodes to measure its performance.

### Problem 2:

* Implement an explicit policy for the cartpole environment without using any learning algorithm. Explain in detail your reasoning behind your policy and run several test episodes to measure its performance.

### Problem 3:

* Apply the cross-entropy method to mountain car. Explain how many episodes are needed to learn a good policy. Explain which reward you use (original, modified).

### Problem 4:

* List all algorithms and methods that we have covered in this course. Write 3 sentences to describe what each algorithm and method solves etc.

I suggest that you use GitHub's editing for markdown files to create the list.
